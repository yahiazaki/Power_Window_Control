# Project Title
### Power window control system

# Project Description
The project aims to develop an advanced and efficient control mechanism for the front passenger door window in a vehicle. Utilizing the Tiva C microcontroller and the FreeRTOS real-time operating system, the project will implement dual control panels for both the passenger and driver, ensuring convenience and flexibility. Key features include the integration of two limit switches to prevent the window motor from exceeding its upper and lower bounds, and an obstacle detection system using a push button to simulate jamming. The system will offer manual open/close functions, one-touch auto open/close capabilities, a window lock function to disable all windows except the driverâ€™s, and a jam protection feature that reverses the window when an obstacle is detected. This project highlights the use of modern microcontroller technology and real-time operating systems to enhance automotive safety and user experience.
